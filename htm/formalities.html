                    <dt>REFERENCE: MODIFICATION OF LAW N° 833, CONSTRUCTION LAW</dt>
                    <dd>In view of the publication in Scope No. 247 in La Gaceta on Tuesday, October 17, 2017, regarding the Modification to Law No. 833, Construction Law - Sole Article, it is reported that this reform corresponds to the modification of Articles 33, 41 and 83; also generating Article 83 bis of said Law.
                        The Municipality of Desamparados, due to a series of information that has circulated in various media, clarifies which works must request a construction permit according to the aforementioned reform and what is indicated in Article 83 bis, which states the following:</dd>
                    <dt>Article 83 bis- Permit for minor works</dt>
                    <br>
                        • Any person may carry out repairs, remodeling, extensions and other minor works, on their own or on behalf of third parties, without the need to have the authorization of the professional contemplated in article 83 of this law, as long as said works do not exceed the equivalent to ten base salaries, calculated in accordance with the provisions of article 2 of Law No. 7337, of May 5, 1993, but must have a license issued by the corresponding municipal unit, which will have the obligation to monitor the works for which you have authorized the license. (underlining is not part of the original). </br></br>
                        • The conditions for this type of construction must be regulated by a construction regulation for minor works, issued by the respective municipality. This regulation will consider the protection of property, public health, human and animal life that will use it, absolute respect for environmental sustainability and all regulations considered by the municipality, based on comprehensive development that guarantees the right to an environment healthy and balanced, individual and collective.</br></br> 
                        • Construction works that, according to the specialized technical criteria of the competent municipal official, include modifications to the structural, electrical or mechanical system of a building, which put the safety of its occupants at risk, will not be considered minor works.
                        If within the period of twelve months, counted from the granting of a minor work permit, which establishes repairs, remodeling, extensions and other minor works, new applications for minor works are submitted on the same property, the municipality, After inspection, it will deny the new permit if it is determined that a major work is being divided into sections to evade the respective controls, without prejudice to the interested party being able to request a construction permit, in accordance with the provisions of article 83 of this law.
                        (As added by the sole article of Law No. 9482 of September 26, 2017)</br></br>
                        • From what is stipulated in said Article, it is clear that for the execution of construction works a municipal license is required, that the modification to the Law focuses on the fact that works with a value of ten minimum wages do not require the presentation of plans. construction projects approved by the CFIA. There is no exemption at any time from submitting applications for construction permits, under the premise that all work must request a construction permit or license from the Municipality. It is worth mentioning that since 2007 the Municipality of Desamparados, through the Territorial Planning Plan, regulated the issue of the requirements for carrying out works on the edge, by categorizing them into minor work and major work.</br></br>
                        • Any construction, regardless of its area or cost, that includes modifications to the structural, electrical or mechanical system of a building, or that may eventually compromise the safety of its occupants, requires the participation of a professional registered with the CFIA. In this case, the major work criteria defined in Article 46 of the Territorial Planning Plan of the Canton of Desamparados apply.</br></br>

                        • Works that are not affected by what is indicated in the previous point may be carried out without needing the authorization of the professional contemplated in Article 83 bis of the Construction Law, as long as they adhere to the definition of minor work ( Work with an area equal to or less than 40m), included in Article 46 of the Territorial Planning Plan. In the case of home extensions, on the second floor in an area less than 40 m, the presentation of a sketch signed by a Responsible Professional, registered with the CFIA, is required.
